# Bird_vs_Drone_project
## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to build a robust real-time object detection system that can differentiate between birds and drones using YOLOv8 — a cutting-edge deep learning model optimized for speed and accuracy.
Such systems have real-world applications in:
- 🔒 Security & Surveillance (detecting unauthorized drones)
- ✈️ Airports & Flight Zones (avoiding collisions with birds)
- 🐦 Wildlife Monitoring (tracking birds without confusing them for drones)
